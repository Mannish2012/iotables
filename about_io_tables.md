Suppose a nation's economy is composed of $n$ sectors. Per sector, consider a **production vector**,
$x$, in $R^n$ that lists it's output per year. The entries in this vector denote the contribution
of every sector (including itself) to it. 

For example, suppose we have a simplified economy that consists of only 3 sectors, *Manufacturing*,
*Agriculture* and *Services*. Consider the table below: 

|Purchased from|Manufacturing|Agriculture|Services|
|------------- |------------- | ----------- | --------|
|Manufacturing | 0.5         | 0.4 | 0.2|
|Agriculture   | 0.4         | 0.2 | 0.1|
|Services      | 0.3         | 0.3 | 0.3|

The columns represent the *contributions* of other sectors to each sector (including itself). 
For example, in our example, $50\%$ of inputs to the manufacturing sector came from manufacturing 
itself, $40\%$ from agriculture, and $30\%$ from services. 

The column sums must be less than 1.
