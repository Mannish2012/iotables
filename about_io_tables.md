Suppose a nation's economy is composed of $n$ sectors. Per sector, consider a **production vector**,
$x$, in $R^n$ that lists it's output per year. The entries in this vector denote the contribution
of every sector (including itself) to it. 

For example, suppose we have a simplified economy that consists of only 3 sectors, *a*,*b* and *c*.
